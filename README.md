# Translator App

This is a simple translator application built with React. The app allows users to input speech in English (via microphone) and translate it into a selected target language.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Converts spoken English into text using the microphone.
- **Language Translation:** Translates the recognized English text into a target language of your choice.
- **Target Language Selection:** Choose the desired language before tapping the "Translate" button.

## How It Works

1. Speak into the microphone (input is recognized only in English).
2. Select the target language from the dropdown menu.
3. Tap the "Translate" button to see the translated text.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with microphone access enabled.
- Internet connection for translation services.
